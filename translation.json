	"downtime_activity_acquire_asset":"Gain temporary use of an asset: One special item or a set of common items (enough for a Squad of your Tier scale), A Cohort (a specialist or fire team), A vehicle, A service (transport from a logistics team, use of a warehouse for temporary storage, legal representation, etc). “Temporary use” is a period of time that is reasonable for the asset, usually the duration of the next mission. An asset may also be put on standby for future use. You might get a fire team to guard your FOB and they’ll stay until after the first serious battle, or until a week goes by and they get reassigned. To acquire the asset, roll the Squad’s Tier. The result indicates the Quality of the asset you get, using the Squad’s Tier as the base. 1-3: Tier-1, 4/5: Tier, 6: Tier+1, Crit: Tier+2. You can spend Materiel to raise the result of this roll beyond Crit by spending 2 Materiel per additional Tier level added. The GM may set a minimum Quality level required to get that particular asset. For example, if you want an intact enemy mech and credentials, you’d need to acquire a Tier IV asset. Anything less isn’t enough. If you re-acquire an asset you get +1d to your roll. If you continue to get the same asset over and over again you can essentially rent it forever. Chemicals, poisons, and dangerous gadgets are going to raise some eyebrows. When you acquire one of these items (rather than making it yourself), you take -2 trust with your Patron Faction. If you want to permanently add an asset to the Squad you can either get it as a Squad upgrade, make owning it a long-term project, or spend Materiel points equal to the new vehicle’s Load AND 1 Materiel +1 Materiel per level of the squad’s Tier.\n Acquiring an asset during Downtime is generally used to further a pilot’s or squad’s goals separate from the needs of a mission. This may include getting a doctor, renting out a restaurant to impress someone, getting a transport vehicle for an “unsupervised” trip, etc. The asset acquired may be useful for an upcoming mission, but if an asset is needed during a mission a Flashback is likely required. You can spend 1 Materiel for +1d to the Acquire Asset roll, or to increase the result by 1 level.\nIf you want to take advantage of a Region's resources, you can take a number of bonus dice equal to the Region’s Might (if acquiring a Cohort) or Tech (if acquiring Pilot or Vehicle Gear). However you lose Trust equal to the number of bonus dice rolled with the Faction that controls the Region.",
	"downtime_activity_collect":"Choose a Region to Collect from, and roll dice equal to its Wealth rating. Gain an amount of Supply Points equal to the highest die rolled. However, those supplies aren't meant for you. If any of the dice come up as a 1, gain the Supply Points, but then immediately roll an Entanglement on the table determined by your Relationship with the Faction that controls that Region. If a Faction does not control the Region, use your Status with the Squad that has the strongest presence in the Region.\nThis can be supplemented by trading Supply Points at a rate of 1 Personnel spent to gain 1 Materiel (or 1 Materiel for 1 Personnel) representing forcibly setting market prices on locals.",
	"downtime_activity_cut_loose":"When your pilot cuts loose you’ll remove some Stress from your Stress track. Pick another pilot and describe how the two of you spend time dealing with the pressure you’re under. This can only be done as a Downtime action because to really dump some anxiety takes a fair bit of time. However, you can decide that your pilot skips the next mission (perhaps going AWOL) so they can cut loose, and you’ll play a different member of the Squad for that mission. This might be a new squaddie, a friend, or an already familiar NPC, any of which will help further flesh out the squad’s cast.  \nTo see how much Stress you relieve, roll dice equal to the number of Ticks in your Connection Clock with the pilot joining you, heal Stress equal to the highest die result, then add another Tick to the Connection Clock. The accompanying pilot does not increase their Connection as they are often asymmetrical, they also do not add dice to the Cut Loose roll for participating. Cohorts cannot be the accompanying “pilot.” Cohorts or other pilots can be present in the scene but they do not provide additional dice, and the scene should focus on the two required pilots. You can spend 1 Personnel point for +1d to the Cut Loose roll, or increase the result by 1.  \nIf the Connection Clock fills, ask the target pilot for a truth about one of the Beliefs tied to them, then reset it to 1 Tick as you see them in a new light. It’ll take time and effort to understand them again and relearn their rhythms, so the pilot erases all the Beliefs they have for that pilot, and writes a new one based on the question asked. After they’ve revealed a truth about themselves you both take 1 XP which can be put into any attribute or into the pilot Playbook.  \nIf you cut loose and roll to heal more Stress than you have then you’ve overindulged. Sometimes people get lost in in the thing that makes them feel better; everything in moderation after all. When you overindulge you’ve behaved poorly and made choices you’ll likely come to regret. This could express itself in a variety of ways, so choose one way you overindulged from the following: Attract Trouble (roll an additional entanglement), Brag (take -2 Trust with your patron Faction), AWOL (Your pilot vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different pilot until this \none returns from their “vacation.” When your pilot returns they’ve also healed all their Harm), or Impropriety (Reset your Connection with the pilot that joined you to 0 as you make an ass of yourself. If your Connection is already 0 take the Level 1 Harm “alone.”).  \nAt the end of your Downtime actions if you have Scars you will suffer 1 Stress per Scar unless you have Cut Loose at least once during the Downtime phase.",
	"downtime_activity_enhance":"When you spend time to improve your vehicle add 1 mark to the Vehicle Enhance track. If you have the Testing Facility Squad upgrade mark 2 instead.",
	"downtime_activity_fix":"When you use technological know how and materials to fix a vehicle roll Engineer. If you lack a Workshop Squad Upgrade it costs 2 Stress to repair your vehicle as you lack the proper equipment to do proper repairs. The damaged vehicle marks segments on its mend Clock according to the Engineer result. 1-3: one segment, 4/5: two segments, 6: three segments, Crit: five segments. When the mend Clock is full reduce each detail of Damage the vehicle has by one level, then clear the Clock. Any remaining segments roll over to the now empty Clock. Whenever the vehicle suffers any new Damage clear any Ticks on its mend Clock. You can spend 1 Materiel point for +1d to the Fix roll, or to increase the result by 1 level.",
	"downtime_activity_long_term_project":"When you work on a Project (whether it’s new or partially completed), describe how your pilot advances the Project, and roll an appropriate action. Mark segments of the Project Clock according to your result: 1-3: one segment, 4/5: two segments, 6: three segments, Crit: five segments. A long-term project can cover any kind of endeavour that takes a great deal of time. Researching a new beam weapon, finding a missing person, building a romance, finding a personal sponsor, and many more possibilities. The GM will determine how many segments the Project Clock has depending on what the goal is. To work on a Project you actually need the tools, skills, resources, etc. to fulfill it, and that might be a necessary preliminary project. For example, you might want to make deals with a group of guerrillas but you don’t have any way to contact them. As prep for that you could build a good rapport with the civilians who live in the area the guerrillas operate and once you have their trust then you could work on contacting the soldiers. You can spend 1 Personnel point for +1d to the Long-Term Project roll, or to increase the result by 1 level.",
	"downtime_activity_manufacture":"See the Crafting Section in book",
	"downtime_activity_recover":"When you get treatment to heal your pilot’s Harm you use the Recover Downtime Activity. To do this you need to get medical care from a medic, veterinarian, autodoc, or someone else with a good amount of anatomical knowledge. If none of the PCs can fill that need, and you don’t have a contact who can either, an Acquire Asset action can get you access to the professional or machine that you need which can then provide for the whole Squad. Recovery is a long-term project. Your healer rolls (Engineer for a PC with the Doctor ability or the Quality level of an NPC) and the patient marks segments on their healing Clock. 1- 3: one segment, 4/5: two segments, 6: three segments, Crit: five segments. When the healing Clock fills up reduce each instance of Harm the patient has by one level, then clear the Clock. Any remaining segments roll over to the now empty Clock. If you attempt to heal yourself and have the Doctor ability you take 2 Stress after you roll. If you want to just wait to spend your Recover activity convalescing to heal naturally take 1 Stress and roll 0d. Note that the pilot being healed is the one who takes the Recover activity. Healing a patient doesn’t cost any Downtime activities for the healer. Whenever you suffer new Harm, clear any Ticks on your healing Clock. You can spend 1 Personnel point for +1d to the Recover roll, or to increase the result by 1 level.",

	"downtime_activity_slavage":"When you take apart a damaged vehicle for its valuables roll Engineer and gain Supply points according to the result. 1-3: 1 Supply Point, 4/5: 2 Supply Points, 6: 3 Supply Points, Critical: 5 Supply Points. If the vehicle is intact consider a mission or Long Term Project to sell it instead of salvaging. Salvaging a vehicle destroys it regardless of how many Supply Points are pulled from the machine.",
